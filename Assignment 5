34. 
a. A(x) = x is even B(x) = x is odd
The wff is not vaild because a number cannot be odd and even at the same time.
b. P(x,y) = x + y = 0
The wff would not be valid because one single x will not equal 0 when add with every y integer. 
c. P(x) = x > 30 Q(x) = x > 3
The wff would not be valid because there is a number greater than 30 but not all numbers are greater than 3.
d. A(x) = x is odd
The wff would not be valid because every number is odd would be a false statement.
